# Decision Maker App

This is a simple PHP application that helps users make a random choice from a list of options they enter.

## Features

- `FormRenderer` — renders a clean HTML form
- `DecisionProcessor` — processes and filters user input
- `index.php` — the main controller handling logic and output

## How It Works

1. The user enters several options separated by commas.
2. On form submission, one of the options is randomly selected.
3. The result is displayed on the page.
